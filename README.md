## Flow
- User sends query
- Backend checks onboarding rules
- If knowledge query → RAG triggered
- Relevant brochure content injected into prompt
- Gemini generates grounded answer
- Response returned with optional source tag

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
### When a user asks a knowledge-based question (e.g., fee deadline):
- The system detects keywords
- Loads admission brochure content
- Injects brochure context into the prompt
- Forces the model to use only official information
- Returns answer with source attribution
  
This reduces hallucination and improves reliability.

## Responsible AI Implementation
### Admit-Assist follows responsible AI principles:
- Data Transparency – Uses only official brochure data
- Explainability – Displays source for RAG answers
- Bias Avoidance – No demographic inference
- Human-in-the-loop – Critical decisions not automated
- Limited Data Storage – Minimal persistence
